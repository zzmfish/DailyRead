## Sandboxing

* restricting file system access

* constructs an `execroot/` directory for each action

* `execroot/` contains all input files to the action

<center>🐣🐣🐣</center>

## Reasons for sandboxing

* not know if a tool uses undeclared input files

* incorrect reuse of cache entries creates problems during remote caching

* closely related to remote execution

<center>🐣🐣🐣</center>

## sandboxfs

* a FUSE file system

* exposes an arbitrary view of the underlying file system

<center>🐣🐣🐣</center>

## Debugging

#### Deactivated namespaces

On some platforms user namespaces are deactivated by default due to security concerns.

#### Rule execution failures

#### Detailed debugging for build failures

If your build failed, use `--verbose_failures` and `--sandbox_debug` to make Bazel show the exact command.
