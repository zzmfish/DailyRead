## Background

#### Visual C++

* GUI
* easy to debug
* not suitable for Linux

#### GCC

* developed by GNU
* official compiler for the GNU and Linux systems

#### LLVM

* modularized 
* a background for compilers in multiple languages
* C, C++, Objective-C, or Objective-C++ compiler
* Apache 2.0 license

## Development History of Clang and LLVM

#### LLVM

| Time | Person        | Event                                                        |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2000 | Chris Lattner | LLVM was originated from the research to create a dynamic compilation technology for all static and dynamic languages |
| 2003 |               | 1.0 was released                                             |
| 2005 |               | Apple hired Chris and his team to develop programming languages and compilers for Apple computers |
| 2011 |               | LLVM 3.0 was released to become the default XCode compiler   |

#### Clang

| Time | Person | Event                                                        |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2007 |        | Development started and the C compiler was first completed   |
| 2009 |        | Clang for Objective-C cloud be fully used for the production environment |
